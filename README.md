# Terran Project

The Terran project was born to further the intrests of humanity. All those who choose to use TerranPool.com, TerranMiner or Terran coin will be activly funding research and development of technologies, missions, and the eventual colonization of other worlds.  

## Mission statment

The Terran Projects mission is to advance human civilization. We will fund missions and technological research that will take Human civilication from from Type 1 to the eventual goal of a Type 3 civilization. The Terran Project will be made of democratic, open sourceed, decentralized, censorship resistant, private code designed to last millenia and avoid the centralization of power.
if at any point the project can not claim to be democratic, open sourced, decentralized, censorship resistant, priave code then let it no longer be known as the Terran Project

## Misson goals

* Caputure an asteroid for resources
* Build an orbital habitat and refinery
* Build an orbital shipyard
* build exploration vessels
* build colony ships


## Funding goals

The Terran project will be funded through transaction fees on the Terran coin network, terranpool.com and through the use of the TerranMiner software.



* There shall be a 2.0% fee for all funds mined on TerranPool. of these 1.75% shall be put into a mission pool fund and 0.25% shall be kept as a developer and administrative fee.
* The 1.75% that is kept shall be kept inside a Dapp controlled smart contract treasury that will unlock after 5 years allowing time for the funds to mature and grow. 
* Once the maturation cycle is complete the funds shall be used to for either a mission or research and development as voted on by the network as a whole.
* votes will be cast through tokens that will be auto generated on the Terran Coin network on 5 year cycles.
* There will be a 1 week voting period during which time contributers in the network will have time to cast their votes by sending tokens to one of the mission or research addresses. Tokens will only be accepted at these addresses and will have no transaction fees attached.
* Mission and research proposals shall be submitted by the network to the lead developers
* Once a mission or research has been selected funding will be paid out over time to the entity, company, group or individual that has been selected to facilitate the sucessful completion of the mission. If at any time the network believe that that entity, company, group or individual is not acting in good faith in representing their intrests then a second vote can be cast to cease funding and select a new entity, company, group or individual to facilitate the mission.
